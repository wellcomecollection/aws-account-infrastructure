# account_roles

This module creates our standard set of IAM roles inside an AWS account.
These roles include:

*   Some standard roles we use in all our AWS accounts (admin, developer, read_only)
*   Some roles we create for D&T to run automated infosec monitoring tools in our account

See [our GitBook docs](https://docs.wellcomecollection.org/aws-account-setup/users-iam-roles-accounts-and-so-on/what-are-out-standard-roles) for an overview of these roles.
