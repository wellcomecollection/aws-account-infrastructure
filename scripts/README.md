These are scripts to do stuff in AWS.

## The individual scripts

<dl>
  <dt>
    <code>describe_iam_access_key.py [ACCESS_KEY_ID]</code>
  </dt>
  <dd>
    This is a tool for getting information about an IAM Access Key â€“ for example, which account it's in, which user it's associated with, what permissions it has.
    This can be useful when you have an Access Key ID but no other information to assist in your debugging.
